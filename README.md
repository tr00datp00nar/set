# :deciduous_tree: Set

This is a collection of tools for setting various system settings. I have put it into a command branch for inclusion into my c Bonzai stateful command tree.

If you just want to try it out, grab the release binary with curl and put into your PATH:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/set/releases/latest/download/set-linux-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/set
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/set/releases/latest/download/set-darwin-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/set
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/set/releases/latest/download/set-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/set
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/set/releases/latest/download/set-windows-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/set
```
## Wallpaper
Currently only supported on Linux. Change the current wallpaper directory using `gconf`.
